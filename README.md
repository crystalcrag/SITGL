# SITGL
Simple Interface Toolkit - GL edition

Library is 99% complete (including doc), but need to write a brief explanation here (when and if I got time).

This is yet another library to manage an immediate mode user interface on top of OpenGL, where the rendering of widgets is entirely themable (in fact, this is not an option: default theme is mostly blank).

Probably not the best and most feature complete of all, but it has a few interesting features:
* Rather small footprint (350K on Win32), without dependencies (it is entirely written in C99).
* API is designed for productivity in mind: write as little code as possible, even if performance may suffer a little.
* Ease of integration: very versatile and kind of battle tested on a real 3D engine.
* Thoroughly documented: the documentation will explain nearly everything there is to know about this library.


This library was designed for the sole purpose of this [engine](https://github.com/crystalcrag/MCEdit2).
